# AI Output Disclaimer and Conditions of Use

Effective date: 2025-09-01

This document explains the limits of responsibility for the Ollamarama Matrix bot ("the App"). It is informational and not legal advice. It supplements, and does not replace, the AGPL‑3.0 License and any Terms of Service included in this repository or user interface.

## 1) Purpose and Scope

- Clarifies that chat responses come from large language models (LLMs) you configure (e.g., via Ollama) and/or third‑party providers you choose.
- Allocates responsibility for use and consequences to you and to the model providers—not to the App author(s).
- Sets conditions of use. If you disagree, do not use the App.

## 2) Definitions

- "App": This Matrix chatbot and accompanying materials.
- "LLMs/Providers": Local or third‑party large language models and services (e.g., Ollama, OpenAI, etc.) that you enable and supply credentials for.
- "Outputs": Any text, images, or actions generated or triggered by the models.
- "You": Any user, administrator, or organization using or distributing the App.

## 3) Nature of the Service

- The App helps compose and send prompts to models you select and configure.
- You supply and control your own model choices.
- The App may include prompt templates; it does not create, host, or operate any models.
- Any defects, harms, or errors attributable to model behavior are the responsibility of the model providers and of the users who choose to act on Outputs.

## 4) No Responsibility for Model Outputs

- You acknowledge that Outputs are generated by models not developed, controlled, or operated by the App author(s).
- The App author(s) are not responsible for any content, actions, decisions, or consequences arising from Outputs, regardless of the prompt templates provided.
- If you disagree with this allocation of responsibility, you are not permitted to use the App.

## 5) No Professional or Emergency Use

- Outputs are not a substitute for professional advice (medical, legal, financial, engineering, safety, etc.).
- Do not use the App or Outputs for crisis response, life‑support, or any safety‑critical context.
- If you or someone you know is in crisis, contact local emergency services or an appropriate hotline. Do not rely on the App or any AI model for crisis intervention.

## 6) Personal Responsibility and User Duties

- Exercise independent judgment; review and verify Outputs before use.
- Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and provider terms.
- Do not input sensitive or confidential information unless you accept the risks.
- You are solely responsible for your prompts, Outputs you choose to act on, and any downstream use or publication.

## 7) Room/Org Administration

- Administrators are responsible for where the bot is invited, who can invoke it, and how Outputs are handled.
- Use moderation and access controls appropriate for your rooms and communities.
- Ensure your deployment policies (e.g., data retention, privacy) are communicated to users.

## 8) Examples of Risk Scenarios (Non‑Exhaustive)

Risks may include, without limitation:

- Self‑harm and mental health: Interactions may affect vulnerable users. Seek professional help; do not rely on AI for crisis support.
- Harmful/illegal instructions: Models may generate unsafe or unlawful guidance. You are responsible for preventing misuse and for actions you take.
- Defamation and reputational harm: Models can produce false or defamatory statements. Independently verify facts before sharing.
- Professional error: Outputs may be inaccurate or incomplete for specialized domains. Consult qualified professionals.
- Safety‑critical errors: Do not use for emergency response, life‑support, or contexts where errors could cause injury, death, or significant damage.
- Privacy and data security: Prompts/Outputs may be logged by providers or Matrix homeservers. Avoid sharing secrets; review provider and homeserver policies.
- Intellectual property: Outputs may resemble copyrighted or proprietary content. Ensure you have rights before using or distributing.
- Bias/offensive content: Models may produce biased or harmful content. Apply your standards and filters.
- Tool/automation: If you enable tool actions, validate inputs/outputs and accept responsibility for results.

## 9) Third‑Party Terms and Data Handling

- Your use of any provider is subject to that provider’s terms, policies, and rate limits.
- The App does not control provider or homeserver logging, retention, or data usage. Review each provider’s documentation and privacy policy.

## 10) Prohibited Uses

- Do not use the App for harassment, bullying, exploitation, stalking, discrimination, or other harmful conduct.
- Do not target minors or vulnerable individuals.
- Do not use the App to violate laws or third‑party rights.

## 11) Allocation of Risk, Limitation of Liability, and Indemnification

- The App is provided “as is,” without warranties of any kind. Use is at your own risk.
- To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App author(s) disclaim all liability for any claim, loss, or damage arising from or related to Outputs or your use of the App.
- You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the App author(s), contributors, and maintainers from and against any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses arising out of or related to your use of the App, your prompts, your reliance on Outputs, or your violation of laws or third‑party rights.

## 12) Acceptance and Conditions of Use

- By using the App, you confirm that you have read and agree to this disclaimer.
- If you do not agree, you must not use the App.

## 13) Updates

This document may be updated over time. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
