# Not a Companion — Please Read

This project is a Matrix chatbot for creative and technical work — exploring ideas, assisting with research, drafting content, and integrating with local models via Ollama. It is explicitly not intended to be a “companion,” therapist, or romantic partner.

## Why this policy exists

- Clarity of purpose: The focus is on productivity, learning, and making things — not simulated relationships.
- Boundaries matter: AI isn’t a person. Treating it as one invites parasocial dynamics the project does not endorse.
- Product direction: Features are prioritized for reliable chat, operations, and integrations — not for emulating intimacy.

## If you were planning to use it as a companion

Please don’t. If you find yourself creating “romance” personas or elaborate backstories to fill a social gap, pause. Step away, talk to a friend, join a community, or put the energy into a project you’ll be proud of.

## Intended uses

- Creative drafting and ideation
- Research assistance with local/private models
- Prototyping workflows and integrations
- Learning, debugging, and exploration

## Not intended uses

- Companionship, romance, or simulated intimacy
- Emotional dependency or therapy replacement
- Anything that treats the model as a person

Thank you for respecting the project’s boundaries and intent.
