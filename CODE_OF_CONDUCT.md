# Code of Conduct

This project exists to learn and build software. To keep the focus on code, contributions and discussions must stay technical and on‑topic.

## Scope

- Applies to all project spaces: issues, pull requests, discussions, and any related channels.

## Expectations

- Keep it technical: report reproducible bugs, propose fixes, or discuss concrete implementation details.
- Stay on‑topic: political, ideological, and social debates are out of scope for this project and will be closed.
- Be respectful: no personal attacks, harassment, or spam. Assume good intent and keep feedback brief and constructive.
- Respect privacy and safety: avoid posting secrets, private data, or content that could put others at risk.

## Enforcement

- Maintainers may edit, close, lock, or remove off‑topic or disruptive content at their discretion.
- Repeated or severe violations may result in restrictions or blocks from participation.

If you want to help, bring code or clear technical problems. Otherwise, please refrain from opening issues or pull requests.
